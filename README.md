## Why

*Make you project sctructure pretty by linting it* üóÇ

Directory structure rules are important part of any project. These rules help to raise clarity of the project and reduce its complexity. Having a clearly defined structure make developers always know where to put files and where to find them. If the project is big enough, it is necessary to avoid chaos in it.

`folderslint` let you configure directory structure rules and check if existed or new files fit these rules.

## Quick Overview

Install `folderslint` globally:

```sh
npm install -g folderslint
```

Setup a config file `.folderslintrc` in the root of the project.

Run `folderslint` to check the whole project or a directory (i.e. `/components`):

```sh
folderslint components
```

## Configuration
`folderslint` needs configuration file named `.folderslintrc` in the root of the project.

The example of the config:

```js
{
  "root": "src", // optional
  "rules": [
    "components/*",
    "pages/components/*/utils",
    "hooks",
    "legacy/**"
   ]
}
```

`root` is the directory the structure of which should be checked.

`rules` is an array of rules which define permitted directory paths.

### Root directory

You have to specify `root` if you want to check structure in a specific directory. Directories which are out if the `root` will not be checked.
If you want all the directories of the project to be checked, you don't need to specify `root`.

### Rules syntax

There are 3 ways to specify a rule:
- the exact path of a directory,
- `*` instead of a directory name if any directory accepted on that level,
- `**` instead of a directory name if any directory accepted on any lower level.

For example:

Rule | Meaning
--- | --- 
`hooks` | ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory `hooks` (and files in it) is accepted.<br/> ‚ùå&nbsp;&nbsp;Any nested directory is not accepted.
`components/*` | ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory `components` is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Any *first level* nested directory is accepted.<br/> ‚ùå&nbsp;&nbsp;Any *second level* nested directory is not accepted. 
`components/*/utils` | ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory `components` is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Any *first level* nested directory is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The *second level* nested directory `utils` is accepted.<br/> ‚ùå&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other *second level* nested directory is not accepted.
`legacy/**` | ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory `legacy` is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Any nested directory on *any level* is accepted.

‚ö†Ô∏è A rule like `components/*/utils` automatically make the `components` and `components/*` rules work. So, no need to specify a rule for every level directory. You need to specify the deepest path.

‚ö†Ô∏è It's not recommended to overuse `**` pattern. It lets absence of structure to sprout in your project. Still it could be useful for some directories which have messy structure by its nature - i.e. `node_modules`, not maintained legacy directories.

## Usage with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
It is handy to use `folderslint` together with `lint-staged`. In this case `folderslint` checks only the files which were modified for a commit.

For that, add `folderslint` to the `lint-staged` section of your `package.json`.

For example, this is how `package.json` can look like if you want to run `folderslint` as a pre-commit hook via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) tool:

```json
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
  }
},
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,ts,tsx}": [
    "folderslint"
  ]
}
  ```
